# OomyceteDB

This is the source code for the OomyceteDB website and database.

## How this site is made

This site is a combination of static [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html) content and dynamic [R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) applications.
For those that want to set up a similar site based on this one, you will need a web server like Apache and an instance of the [R Shiny Server](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-server/) running. We also store and manage the raw data on Google Drive for convenience.
